        I&apos;m an eager software engineer with most my experience being in
        full-stack web development.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        My passion for programming started when I wrote my first HTML page aged
        12, since then I spent 5 years learning 3+ languages and countless
        frameworks to give me a range of tools to work from, whilst creating
        small projects along the way.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        Currently I am working on building up my portfolio with impressive
        projects using various technologies to practice different skills and
        give me more experience.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        I aspire to become a blockchain developer in the future, as I am
        passionate about creating transparent and secure digital solutions.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me watching football,
        watching car-related content, or keeping fit through weight-lifting or
        playing football
      </p>
      <p className="">
        I&apos;m always open to new opportunities and exciting projects, feel
        free to contact me ðŸ™‚
